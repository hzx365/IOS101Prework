## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favourite app 1: GuitarTuna (it's a app that helps us tune the Guitar/Ukulele)
  * It uses microphone to interact with real world
  * It has user friendly interface that helps us walk through

My favourite app 1: Ski Safari (It's a 2D leisure game about skiing)
  * Only need 1 type of operation (press and release) to control 
  * Fancy view and art

My favourite app 2: Hay Day (It's a 2.5D leisure game about farming and raising animals.)
  * Every item has a timer that change its status after a period time (e.g. plants become farmable after some time)
  * Item is upgradable with the cost of some other items.

My App Idea:
I would like to build a calendar app that has implemented astrology reading and fortune telling function. By inputting a birth time, it will tell today's luckness based on astrology and your birthtime.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I tried to use code to change the button's round corner. And it took me some time to use code to do that. After doing some research online and trying several things, finally I figured out
how to use code to self define the button's round corner style, including how many pixels we want the round corner to be.
